# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
I should creat a function which take one arrgument as list and retun a reverse list for it 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
I should creat a function which take one arrgument as list and retun a reverse list for it 
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used on of index properety for lists to solve this challenge which is the shortest and easist way to solve it (O(1))

# Shift an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
I should creat a function which take two arrguments one is array and the second is value and return a new array have that value in the middle of it without using any build-in methods.
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
I should creat a function which take two arrguments one is array and the second is value and return a new array have that value in the middle of it without using any build-in methods.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I will split the array to two array  and append the new value the first part and then merage them again
